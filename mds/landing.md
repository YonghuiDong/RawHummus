# Workflow

The use of <b><span style="color:#F17F42">RawHummus</span></b> is simple. You can follow the user guide in each tab to evaluate your LC-MS system.

It is worth noting that <b><span style="color:#F17F42">RawHummus</span></b> uses the generic file formats, i.e., mzML and mzXML, for analysis. Therefore raw files need to be converted first. There are a number of means to convert the raw files, You can refer to [this page](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/fileconversion/) for more information.

In addition, <b><span style="color:#F17F42">RawHummus</span></b> also provides the option to convert your files with some system requirements. You can refer to the user guide in **MSConvert** tab for details.
